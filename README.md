  ## Description
  I wanted to develop an application that would facilitate the final leg of the development process. Readme files can be pretty time consuming when you are already exausted from all the work you just put into your project. So, it's nice to automate this process and take some of the burden off a developer's shoulders. I was able to get some good practice in both writing functions as well as using prompts when working on this project.

  ## Installation
  Node.js, inquirer

  ## Usage
  Use "node index.js" then follow the prompts.
